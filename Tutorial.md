## Game orientation
> Hi, I am Umi, shopkeeper on a small island on the straits of Neslogaia,
> I will be showing you the ropes of the game!

Project F fishing game based on the cookie clicker style where your click on a button and earn items.
In this game, you are to use `?fish` or `?f` to earn.

Prefix of the discord bot is `?`. To run a command, do `?<command>`.

Earning gives you ways to upgrade your "clicking" power and automate your "clicking"
experience. 

Let's get started.

## Player Stats
> As a newbie, here are a few things you need to take note of.

* `?stats` allows you to view your personal statistics.
Here you can see your stats for Level, Cash, Strength, Rod equipped and Fishes caught.

| Stats         | meaning                     | initial value |
|---------------|-----------------------------|---------------|
| Level         | Your player level           | 1             |
| Cash          | Your current cash           | 0             |
| Strength      | Fishing strength            | 0             |
| Luck          | Fishing luck                | 0             |
| Fishing Rod   | Rod currently equipped      | None          |
| Fishes caught | Total amount of fish caught | 0             |

To catch a fish, your minium strength has to be 1. However, you start of with a strength
of 0, let's fix that. (Go to `Equipping Fishing rod`)

## Equipping Fishing rod
> I know you have just arrived at this island without anything, so here is a `Worned out rod` that
> you can use to start your fishing.

* `?equip <fishing rod>` allows you to equip a fishing rod to increase your stats.

> Do `?equip Worned out rod` to equip the rod I just gave you!

> Now do `?stats` again to check out your new stats.

* `?inventory` allows you to check out all your fishing rods and its stats.

Let's go fishing! (go to `Fishing`)

## Fishing
> There are many places here on Neslogaia to go fishing, let's go to easiest
> place first to fish, `Shoalwater bay`!

* `?travel <location>` allows you to choose and head to the location.

> Do `?travel Shoalwater bay` to travel to Shoalwater bay!

Once you have arrived at `Shoalwater bay` you can use the `?fish` command.

* `?fish` allows you to start fishing.

> Fishing can take a while, so don't panic if your first `?fish` returns nothing.

** Once you have caught a fish **
> Congrats! By catching a fish, you earn cash! Cash can be used to buy items to upgrade
> your stats.

Do note that different places have different fish strength requirements 
in order to catch them. You should increase your strength in order to catch them.
(Higher strength requirement == Better earnings)

Having cash means you can buy stuff at the shop (go to shop).
